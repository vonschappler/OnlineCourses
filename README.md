# Online Courses

This repository will store all the code of courses I have taken on online platforms such as Udemy.

The courses are organized here by the date I took them, and I'll do my best to keep this updated as much as possible, based on what I did, commiting all changes as professionally as possible.

In order to make this happen, I am retaking some classes, and the courses linked here will have their own repositories.

# Online Courses

This repository will store all the code of courses I have taken on online platforms such as Udemy.

The courses are organized here by the date I took them, and I'll do my best to keep this updated as much as possible, based on what I did, commiting all changes as professionally as possible.

In order to make this happen, I am retaking some classes, and the courses linked here will have their own repositories.

Those courses will have their own repositories, and so, it's possible to check them since they were added as submodules of this main repository.

Any new courses taken will be added here, to be kept as refrences of every course I have taken, and their certificates, when available are displayed on this page.
